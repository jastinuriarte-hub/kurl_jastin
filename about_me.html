                <h2>Me</h2>
       
          <p><strong>I am the eldest son in my family and currently 19 years old. I am often described as someone with a good sense of humor, and while I enjoy making people laugh, I am also mindful of ensuring that my jokes remain respectful and considerate. I try to live by my personal guiding principle: “If you don’t understand me, I kindly ask that you be patient and considerate.”<br></strong></p>

<p><strong>  <br> My permanent residence is located at Purok 6, Avocado Street, Bayugan City, but I am presently staying in Purok 9A, Libertad, Butuan City for convenience and accessibility. I am committed, responsible, and eager to contribute positively to the workplace, bringing both professionalism and a positive attitude. </strong></p>

        <h2>Way to reliave stress </h2>
         <p><strong>When I have free time or when I am on academic break, I like hiking with my friends. This is our way of connecting with nature and appreciating the views. It also helps us relieve stress instead of doing bad habits cause stress may affect to your work and focus. That is why when i have a vacant time i like to go to the mountains to reliave stress</strong></p>

        <h2>Academic buddies</h2>
         <p><strong>I consider having this group of friends to be a huge blessing because you can rely on them for academic support, family issues, and even when your wallet is empty. They are like family to me, not just pals.</strong></p>

      <h2>Starts Liking Coding</h2>
      <p><strong>I started to enjoy HTML at this point since we had an ICT project back in grade 9. The teacher gave me the duty of creating a website, which was difficult at first, but it turned out nicely.  </strong></p>
